2. Which Python IDE do you choose and why?

- I used Python's IDLE for performing this task.
- Fortunately, I have an experience of working in Microsoft Visual Studio for a year which makes my easier to catch things up in that environment.
- However, I would like to use PyCharm as an IDE for my projects and tasks.
- The main reason I believe is most of the community and professionals uses it which has a lot of features to deep-dive into.
- Apart from that, it is being used by most of the tutors like YouTube, Udemy, and many more.
- PyCharm seems like a new-option to explore and work around, do my hands dirty with it.
- In my opinion, for me, it is going to be more fun to not only enjoy the ride of Python programming in this new environment (IDE) but also to explore the features and understand why it is popular amongst professionals.
