    "\n",
    "#        Display Your full name and student number\n",
    "#        The program generates a random number between 1 and 20 (inclusive).\n",
    "#        The Player has 6 chances to guesses the answer  incorrectly\n",
    "#        The player has to guess the number with hints provided after each guess.\n",
    "#        The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n",
    "#        The game ends when the player guesses the correct number.\n",
    "# Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#        You must Use Class object method\n",
    "#        Use the random module to generate a random number.\n",
    "#        Use a while loop to allow the player to keep guessing.\n",
    "#        Use if-elif-else statements to check the player's guess and give feedback.\n",
    "#        Use the input function to get the player's guess.\n",
    "#        The game should tell the player how many guesses they took when they guess correctly."
